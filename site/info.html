          <h3>You Have Rights!</h3>
          <p>
            The OER is there to protect the rights of both the students and teachers. This document states, for example,
            how long teachers have to grade your exams and practicals. If a teacher does something that is unacceptable,
            check the OER! Maybe that teacher is doing something that is not allowed.
