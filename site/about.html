              Koen is following the Computer Science course at Utrecht University. He is in his first year, and is currently
              taking the <b>Web Technology</b> and the <b>Databases</b> course. His hobbies include studying, learning about
              computer science, reading the books of his courses and evaluating contents of informational material he happens
              to be involved in at that moment of time, mostly the courses he takes at Utrecht University, where he studies
              Computer Science. He also likes to have one side project that he just does for fun, which currently is
              <a href="https://github.com/KoenDR06/WebTech" target="_blank">this project</a>. It is an informational website
              for students who are studying Computer Science at Utrecht University, just like he does. Lastly, he hates
              repeating information, as repeating information again is "Not needed and it doesn't add anything. Furthermore, it
              adds nothing and is unnecessary".

              Kitty is also doing the Computer Science Bachelor at the University Utrecht. She follows the same courses just like Koen
              and Bas. She is really an active person and doesn't like to sit still. Her hobbies are rock climbing (bouldering), cycling,
              reading books and doing an extra study. She chose informatics because, unlike her body, her code still has a chance
              to run without breaking.

              Bas is also doing the Computer Science Bachelor at the University Utrecht. As a first year student he has the same
              courses as Koen and Kitty. His hobbies include gaming, athletics and not studying. In stead of reading the books of
              his courses, he likes to play real-time strategy and first person shooter games. He can be found at the athletics club
              of Maarssen all evenings of the work-week.
