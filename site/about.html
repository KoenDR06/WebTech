              Koen is following the Computer Science course at Utrecht University. He is in his first year, and is currently
              taking the <b>Web Technology</b> and the <b>Databases</b> course. His hobbies include studying, learning about
              computer science, reading the books of his courses and evaluating contents of informational material he happens
              to be involved in at that moment of time, mostly the courses he takes at Utrecht University, where he studies
              Computer Science. He also likes to have one side project that he just does for fun, which currently is
              <a href="https://github.com/KoenDR06/WebTech" target="_blank">this project</a>. It is an informational website
              for students who are studying Computer Science at Utrecht University, just like he does. Lastly, he hates
              repeating information, as repeating information again is "Not needed and it doesn't add anything. Furthermore, it
              adds nothing and is unnecessary".

              Kitty is also doing the Computer Science Bachelor at the University Utrecht. She follows the same courses just like Koen
              and Bas. She really likes programming different languages, just like LABview even though many people despise it.In this
              bachelor she can combine her knowledge of physics and mathematics with the knowledge of Computer Science, allowing her
              to apply analytical and problem-solving skills across multiple disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is really an active person and doesn't like to sit still. She has engaged in various active pursuits, including
              cycling, hiking in Germany and Belgium, cross-fitness, swimming, and her personal favoriteâ€”bouldering. Furthermore,
              she likes to read books in her spare time about fiction or science. She chose informatics because, unlike her body,
              her code still has a chance to run without breaking.

            <p>
              Bas is also doing the Computer Science Bachelor at the University Utrecht. As a first year student he has the same
              courses as Koen and Kitty. He choise Computer Science because he enjoyed the subject at highschool. So far, his favorite
              course so far is Webtechnologie. He likes more pratical courses where he can work on code, because he enjoys the practical
              problemsolving it requires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bas' hobbies include gaming, athletics and not studying. In stead of reading the books of his courses, he likes to play 
              real-time strategy and first person shooter games. He can be found at the athletics club of Maarssen all evenings of the 
              work-week. One could say he is addicted. He is not only an athlete, but also a trainer.
