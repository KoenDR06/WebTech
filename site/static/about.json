        "Bas is also doing the Computer Science Bachelor at the University Utrecht. As a first year student he has the same courses as Koen and Kitty. He choise Computer Science because he enjoyed the subject at highschool. So far, his favorite course is Webtechnologie. He likes more pratical courses where he can work on code, because he enjoys the practical problemsolving it requires.",
        "Bas' hobbies include gaming, athletics and not studying. In stead of reading the books of his courses, he likes to play real-time strategy and first person shooter games. He can be found at the athletics club of Maarssen all evenings of the work-week. One could say he is addicted. He is not only an athlete, but also a trainer."

        "Koen is following the Computer Science course at Utrecht University. He is in his first year, and is currently taking the <b>Web Technology</b> and the <b>Databases</b> course. His hobbies include studying, learning about computer science, reading the books of his courses and evaluating contents of informational material he happens to be involved in at that moment of time, mostly the courses he takes at Utrecht University, where he studies Computer Science. He also likes to have one side project that he just does for fun, which currently is <a href=\"https://github.com/KoenDR06/WebTech\" target=\"_blank\">this project</a>. It is an informational website for students who are studying Computer Science at Utrecht University, just like he does. Lastly, he hates repeating information, as repeating information again is \"Not needed and it doesn't add anything. Furthermore, it adds nothing and is unnecessary\"."
